# 📁 Resources I used to pass the exam

## Professor Messer 

I watched this entire YouTube playlist by Professor Messer to jog my memory on the security terms. Make sure to differentiate between related security terms.

## Practice Exams

- I did 5+ sets of practice exams online, in which the questions did not appear in the exam at all. However, the knowledge on cybersecurity terms still is useful to understand.

## Conclusion

- Overall the MCQ of the exams were scorable if the person taking the exam has cybersecurity knowledge. However, the subjective parts of the exam requires one to have hands-on knowledge and critical thinking skills. I believe this is achieveable by drawing network diagrams, reading firewall logs and making conclusions, and playing around with Wireshark to get familiar with security protocols.
