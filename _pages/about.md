Hi I am Azim, the local tech guy for friends and family. I am currently interning at Vigilant Asia as a SOC Analyst. Whenever I have spare time, I improve my knowledge on cybersecurity by reading blogs and news on the latest cyber threats. 

Previously, I focused on hands-on learning of offensive and defensive security on TryHackMe and competing in CTF competitions. 

I aspire to be a purple teamer in the cybersecurity industry, contribute more to open source and improve the security posture of existing and future cybersecurity systems and infrastructure.
